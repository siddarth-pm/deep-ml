Collection of my solutions to deep ml problems!

Each problem has a solution using (a) pytorch, (b) numpy, and importantly (c) einsum. I'm of the opinion that becoming fluent with einsum is probably one of the most useful skills to have in the ML research space and this is my way of adding some more practice & going over the basics to ensure fluency.

Trying to do 1-2 a day! Lots of things going on so the progress may be slow.
