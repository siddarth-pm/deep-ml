# Deep-ml solutions
Collection of my solutions to [deep-ml](https://www.deep-ml.com) problems! I'm trying to do 1-2 a day, but have lots of things going on so the progress may be slow.

Each problem has a solution (may have a solution) using (a) pytorch, (b) numpy, and importantly (c) einsum. I'm of the opinion that becoming fluent with einsum is probably one of the most useful skills to have in the ML research space and this is my way of adding some more practice & going over the basics to ensure fluency. Some of the problems may not have an einsum solution (e.g. linear regression w/ gradient descent), but I'll try to use einsum as much as possible where I can.
